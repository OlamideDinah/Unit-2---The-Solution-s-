        <div id="fact1">
            Both Sdgs 7 and 15 are extremely severe problems with the potential to reak havoc on our planet.If we don't start using sustainable Energy, we will soon see ourselves run out of things such as oil and coal. Since we're so dependant on these materials, many of us would lose power and we would likely see a worldwide crisis. To add to this, the use of unsustainable sources also has a horrible effect on our environment, evident by the recent outbreak of climate crisises. In this sense Sdg 15 is similar to Sdg7. If we keep chopping down trees and killing animals we will see a horrible change in our planet. Without trees taking C02 out of the atmosphere, we will undoubedtly plunge further into a Climate Crisis.
        </div>
        <button class="factA" onclick="fact2()">Cause</button> <!-- button 1 / fact 2 !-->
        <div id="fact2">
            Both of these Sdgs are issues caused by humans. Frankly, if we weren't here they likely wouldn't be needed. Our dependance on Energy has caused us to use unsustainable sources, whereas our desires for equipments and tools such as paper have required us to destroy trees and animals worldwide.
        </div>
        <button class="factA" onclick="fact3()">How do they Relate?</button> <!-- button 1 / fact 3 !-->
        <div id="fact3">
            As mentioned above, Sdgs 15 and 7 actually have a deep correlation. If we start using sustainable energy sources, our climate would improve thus improving life on land. Likewise, if we stopped chopping down trees, we would see less C02 in the environment, meaning the need for sustainable energy wouldn't be as dire. Understanding the link between Sdgs 7 and 15 is extremely important.
        </div>
        <button class="factA" onclick="fact4()">Why is this important?</button> <!-- button 1 / fact 4 !-->
        <div id="fact4">
            If we understnad the relationship between Sdgs 15 and 7, we can develop a better approach at tackling both of them at once. For example, we could develop a detailed plan of action that would have targeted changes to help stop both goals. For example, providing electricity access to those in underdeveloped countries would improve their quality of life. And stopping the creation of huge oil drills and plants would leave a lot more green space on our planet.
        </div>
        <button class="factA" onclick="fact5()">How You Can Help</button> <!-- button 1 / fact 5 !-->
        <div id="fact5">
            You can help further both Sdg7 and 15. For both goals, you can donate to organizations dedicated to the cause. You can also Contact local government officials and ask them what their plans for helping with both goals are. In both scenarios, everything helps and it's essantial that we send the message of the Sdgs to older generations.
            <br> To summarize, here are 4 more ways you can help: a) Educate yourself and your others. b) Start fundraising campaigns. c) Promote volunteering. d) Use your connections to empower changemakers.
